Quotes and Thoughts
-------------------

*   _"For a successful technology," Feynman concluded, "reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled."_
    
*   _"India is a country where if we shared notes, we think we could not score good marks. This is the zero-sum mindset we have. In entrepreneurship, we could all become extremely wealthy by sharing notes." ~Kunal Shah_
    
*   _"More broadly, nobody is going to teach you to think for yourself. A large fraction of what people around you believe is mistaken. Internalize this and practice coming up with your own worldview. The correlation between it and those around you shouldn't be too strong unless you think you were especially lucky in your initial conditions." ~Patrick Collison_
    
*   _"Steve used to say to me — and he used to say this a lot — 'Hey Jony, here’s a dopey idea.' And sometimes they were. Really dopey. Sometimes they were truly dreadful. But sometimes they took the air from the room and they left us both completely silent. Bold, crazy, magnificent ideas. Or quiet simple ones, which in their subtlety, their detail, they were utterly profound. And just as Steve loved ideas, and loved making stuff, he treated the process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence. You see, I think he better than anyone understood that while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished." ~Jony Ive_
    
*   _“Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the wise; seek what they sought.” ~Matsuo Basho_
    
*   _"When you reach out to other people, half the time they don’t respond, but half the time they do. It’s asymmetric; it doesn’t really cost too much when they don’t, and it can be incredibly rewarding when they do. If I did not do that, I would have missed out on a huge amount." ~Patrick Collison_
    
*   _"There is a difference between knowing the path & walking the path" ~Morpheus, The Matrix_
    
*   _“I can’t begin to tell you the things I discovered while I was looking for something else.” ~Shelby Foote_
    
*   _“It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit.” ~H. S. Truman_
    
*   _“I would never again be made a foot soldier in a conflict I did not understand.” ~Tara Westover_
    
*   _“The past was a ghost, insubstantial, unaffecting. Only the future had weight.” ~Tara Westover_
    
*   _“I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.” ~Andy Bernard(Nard Dog)_
    
*   _“When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it. The minute you understand that you can poke life and that if you push something in, something will pop out the other side. That you can change it and you can mold it…that may be the most important thing, to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you’re just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.” ~Steve Jobs_
    
*   _“Don't tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results.” ~George S. Patton_
    
*   _"You've got to be a really good talent scout because no matter how smart you are, you need a team of great people. You've got to figure out how to size people up fairly quickly, make decisions without knowing people too well and hire them and see how you do and refine your intuition ... because you need great people around you." ~Steve Jobs_
    
*   _“It could be tedious, sleep-inducing work. So I came up with an idea. I’d send a box of Girl Scout Thin Mints with every paper that needed to be reviewed. 'Thank you for agreeing to do this,' I’d write. 'The enclosed Thin Mints are your reward. But no fair eating them until you review the paper.'” ~Randy Pausch_
    
*   _“Others, like Richard Feynman, the theoretical physicist, manage never to lose their ability to come up with fresh ideas. In other words, they learn to nurture their unconscious, and to trust it. Feynman spent a lot of time playing the drums. The great mathematician John Conway spent much of his time playing games. Playing...keeps you ‘fresh.’” ~John Cleese_
    
*   _“It usually takes more than three weeks to prepare a good impromptu speech." ~Mark Twain_
    
*   _“Strong opinions, kindly held, never yelled." ~Shreyas Doshi_
    
*   _"If you want to build a ship, don’t drum people up together to collect wood, and don’t assign them tasks and work. Rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea." ~Antoine de Saint-Exupéry_
    
*   _"Design like you're right; listen like you're wrong." ~John Lilly_
    
*   _"The sensible answer is to listen, absorb, discuss, be able to defend any design decision with clarity and reason, know when to pick your battles and know when to let go." ~Speider Schneider_
    
*   _“We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it and stop there lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove lid again and that is well but also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore.” ~Mark Twain_
    
*   _“If you have nothing to say, say nothing.” ~Mark Twain_
    
*   _"You would not believe how difficult it is to be simple and clear. People are afraid that they may be seen as a simpleton. In reality, just the opposite is true." ~Jack Welch_
    
*   _“Steve Jobs has a saying that A players hire A players; B players hire C players; and C players hire D players. It doesn't take long to get to Z players. This trickle-down effect causes bozo explosions in companies.” ~Guy Kawasaki_
    
*   _“Simplicity is the zenith of a long, arduous journey, not the starting point.” ~Rolf Dobelli_
    
*   _"You have to stick within what I call your circle of competence. You have to know what you understand and what you don't understand. It's not terribly important how big the circle is. But it is terribly important that you know where the perimeter is." ~Charlie Munger_
    
*   _"Invert, always invert: Turn a situation or problem upside down. Look at it backward." ~Charlie Munger_
    
*   _"My biggest punishment, my biggest revenge on you is, I’m gonna make you run this company long term. You had the baby, now you gotta raise the child. And you’re stuck with it for 18 years. I knew he wanted to sell the company.. I’m like, “No, no. You’re running this company.” And I knew he maybe could move faster than me for a year, but he wasn’t gonna keep doing it. And so that was our strategy. We built the company for the long term." ~Brian Chesky_
    
*   _"When an apple has ripened and falls, why does it fall? Because of its attraction to the earth, because its stalk withers, because it is dried by the sun, because it grows heavier, because the wind shakes it, or because the boy standing below wants to eat it? Nothing is the cause. All this is only the coincidence of conditions in which all vital organic and elemental events occur. And the botanist who finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue decays and so forth is equally right with the child who stands under the tree and says the apple fell because he wanted to eat it and prayed for it." ~Leo Tolstoy_
    
*   _“In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn't read all the time -- none, zero. You'd be amazed at how much Warren reads--and at how much I read. My children laugh at me. They think I'm a book with a couple of legs sticking out.” ~Charlie Munger_
    
*   _“I wanted to be in politics but not of politics.” ~Obama_
    
*   _“That was something my mother made sure I understood. Once, she found out that I had been part of a group teasing a kid at school. She sat me down and told me that there were two kinds of people in the world: Those who only think about themselves and tear others down to make themselves feel important. And those who think about how others feel and avoid doing things that might hurt them. 'So,' she asked me, 'Which kind of person do you want to be?'” ~Obama_
    
*   _“I can read about what it was like to lose everything during the Great Depression. But I don’t have the emotional scars of those who actually experienced it. And the person who lived through it can’t fathom why someone like me could come across as complacent about things like owning stocks. We see the world through a different lens.” ~Morgan Housel_
    
*   _“There was an owl liv'd in an oak  
    The more he heard, the less he spoke  
    The less he spoke, the more he heard.  
    O, if men were all like that wise bird."_
    
*   _"Most people, when confronted with something they don’t understand, do not realize they don’t understand it because they’re able to come up with an explanation that makes sense based on their own unique perspective and experiences in the world, however limited those experiences are. We all want the complicated world we live in to make sense. So we tell ourselves stories to fill in the gaps of what are effectively blind spots." ~Morgan Housel_
    
*   _“The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.” ~Sherlock Holmes_
    
*   _“A genius is the man who can do the average thing when everyone else around him is losing his mind.” ~Napoleon_
    
*   _"History is just one damned thing after another."_
    
*   _“Revolutions can, and often have, begun with reading." ~Arundathi Roy_
    
*   _"I just try and avoid being stupid. I have a way of handling a lot of problems. I put them on what I call my too-hard pile. Then I just leave them there. I'm not trying to succeed in my too-hard pile." ~Charlie Munger_
    
*   _“പ്രണയത്തിന്റെയും വിരഹത്തിന്റെയും നഷ്ടത്തിന്റെയും വേദനയുടെയും അപമാനത്തിന്റെയും കരച്ചിലിന്റെയും വാക്കുകൾകൊണ്ട് നെയ്തെടുത്ത ആ പുസ്തകം എന്റെ ഹൃദയത്തെ പൊതിഞ്ഞുപിടിച്ചു. ഒരേ തരത്തിൽ മനസ്സ് പിടയുന്ന രണ്ടുപേർ തമ്മിലുള്ള കണ്ടുമുട്ടലായിരുന്നു അത്. ഒരാൾ എഴുത്തുകാരനെന്ന നിലയിലും മറ്റേയാൾ വായനക്കാരനെന്ന നിലയിലും. അതിലെ ഓരോ വരിയും എനിക്കുവേണ്ടി എഴുതിയതു പോലെയോ ഞാൻ തന്നെ എഴുതിയതുപോലെയോ എനിക്കനുഭവ പ്പെട്ടു. അവയിലൂടെ കടന്നു പോകുമ്പോൾ എന്റെ മനസ്സിലെ കത്തലു കൾക്കുമേൽ കുളിർനീര് കോരിയൊഴിച്ചതുപോലെ ഞാൻ ശാന്തനായി. പിന്നെ 'സമയം കഴിഞ്ഞു. പോകുന്നില്ലേ..?' എന്ന് ആരോ ഒരാൾ വിളിച്ചു ചോദിക്കുന്നതുവരെ ഞാനവിടെ ഇരുന്നു. അന്നത്തെ മാത്രമുള്ള ഒരിരുപ്പ് ആയിരുന്നില്ല, ജീവിതാന്ത്യത്തോളം നീളാൻ പോകുന്ന ഒരു ശീലത്തിന്റെ തുടക്കമായിരുന്നു അത്. എന്നെ ചുംബിച്ചെടുക്കാൻ തക്കം പാർത്തിരുന്ന ഒരു മഹാകയത്തിന്റെ ചുഴിപ്പിടുത്തത്തിൽനിന്നും രക്ഷിച്ച പിടിവള്ളിയും അതുതന്നെയായിരുന്നു... വായന." ~ബെന്യാമിൻ, മാന്തളിരിലെ 20 കമ്മ്യൂണിസ്റ്റ് വർഷങ്ങൾ_
    
*   _“ഫ്രഞ്ചു കവിയായിരുന്ന ലമാർതീൻ തന്റെ പ്രശസ്തമായ കവിത എഴുതിയതിനെക്കുറിച്ച് പറഞ്ഞത്, മരങ്ങൾക്കിടയിലൂടെ ഒരു ദിവസം നടക്കുമ്പോൾ കവിത പൂർണ്ണമായും ഒരു വെളിപാടുപോലെ തനിക്കു ലഭിച്ചു എന്നാണ്. എന്നാൽ, അദ്ദേഹം ഈ കവിത വ്യത്യസ്ത രീതിയിൽ എഴുതിയതും എഴുതിയവതന്നെ നിരവധിതവണ വെട്ടിത്തിരുത്തിയതും മരണശേഷം കണ്ടെത്തുകയുണ്ടായി. ഈ കുറിപ്പിൽ പോലും സത്യമെത്ര നുണയെത്ര എന്ന അളവ് എടുത്താൽ സത്യമോ നുണയോ തുക്കത്തിൽ മുമ്പിൽ നിൽക്കുക എന്ന് ആർക്ക് പറയാൻ കഴിയും?" ~ഉണ്ണി ആർ_
    
*   _"Life is not always black and white, it's a million shades of grey." ~Ridley Scott_
    
*   _"When you are peeling an orange, just peel it with all your heart, and nothing else. When you are watching a film, don't think of what to make for dinner tonight. When you are eating a mango, forget strawberries, your mother-in-law and your impending tax returns. When you put a piece of dark chocolate in your mouth, think of nothing but the smile on your face. When you're tasting a long and slow kiss, don't worry if you've got on the perfect underwear. In the midst of making love, don't ponder how long a relationship will last. When driving on a highway, keep your mind on the road. In the middle of a beautiful dream, don't try to memorise it. Forget all they told you about multi-tasking and time management. If you're not living in the now, you're just not living, period."_
    
*   _"I've always looked at those kids thinking....  
    What silly fools.  
    So full of dreams.  
    They have no idea.  
    But maybe it doesn't matter."  
    ~Carl Mørck, A Conspiracy of Faith_
    
*   _“Either everyone feels like this a little bit and they’re just not talking about it or I am completely fucking alone.” ~Fleabag_
    
*   _"I have lived my life as best I could, not knowing its purpose, but drawn forward like a moth to a distant moon; and here at last, I discover a strange truth. That I am only a conduit, for a message that eludes my understanding...Who are we, who have been so blessed to share our stories like this? To speak across centuries?" ~Ezio Auditore_
    
*   _"And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow."_
    
*   _"എല്ലാവരും പാട്ടുകൾ കേൾക്കുന്നത് നേരം പോകാനും, ആശ്വാസത്തിനും, സമാധാനത്തിനും വേണ്ടിയാണ്. എന്നാൽ ഞാൻ വരികളിൽ ജീവിക്കുന്ന വ്യക്തിയാണ്. ഇഷ്ടപ്പെട്ട വരികൾ വരുന്ന ഭാഗം പിന്നെയും പിന്നെയും കേൾക്കാറുണ്ട്. ചില വരികളിൽ ഞാൻ മരിച്ചു പോകാറുമുണ്ട്."_
    
*   _“There’s a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn’t that kind of the point?” ~The Office._
    
*   _“Storming a breach, conducting an embassy, ruling a nation are glittering deeds. Rebuking, laughing, buying, selling, loving, hating and living together gently and justly with your household – and with yourself – not getting slack nor being false to yourself, is something more remarkable, more rare and more difficult. Whatever people may say, such secluded lives sustain in that way duties which are at least as hard and as tense as those of other lives.” ~Montaigne_
    
*   _“That's what I would call equanimity, or equilibrium, and it's the kind of state of mind that cannot be perfumed in any way by anything that happens outside you. This kind of confidence that comes from there is like the confidence of the sky. Right now it's dark outside, but you know if you went up in a plane, even in the stormiest of days, the sky's brilliant blue underneath. When you look at the sky, and it's made a rainbow, and it's absolutely gorgeous, there's no question that the sky's up there going, ‘Ha, did you see my rainbow?’ Or when it's a terrible, bleak, you know, gray, gloomy day, that the sky's going to apologize. No, the sky just is, because the sky sees the impermanence of the clouds, and the impermanence of the rainbows, and you have to develop an inner state of mind that's as impervious to all the good shit and bad shit that happens to you as the sky is to the weather.” ~Caroline McHugh_
    
*   _“And I kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden, amazing thing about them. I keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can, I keep my mind open, and I'm always prepared to be amazed, and I'm never disappointed. You do the same thing. Go out, talk to people, listen to people, and, most importantly, be prepared to be amazed.” ~Celeste Headlee_
    
*   _“1. Don’t multitask - be present with mind.  
    2\. Enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn. Don’t just try to get your point across. Everybody is an expert in some thing.  
    3\. Use open ended questions. Who what when where why how.  
    4\. Go with the flow. Thoughts will come into your mind and go out of your mind. Let them go. Don’t think for two minutes about a clever question to ask.  
    5\. If you don’t know say that you don’t know.  
    6\. Don’t equate your experience with theirs. It is never the same. It’s not about you. Don’t take that moment. Conversations are not A promotional opportunity.  
    7\. Try not to repeat yourself.  
    8\. Stay out of the weeds. People don’t care about the years the names The dates all those details.  
    9\. Listen. Buddha: if your mouth is open you’re not learning. Calvin Coolidge: no man ever listened his way out of a job. We don’t listen with the intent to understand, we listen with the intent to reply.  
    10\. Be brief. A good conversation is like a miniskirt, short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject.”

*   _“We suffer more often in imagination than in reality” ~Seneca_
    
*   _“In a society that benifit from your self doubt and insecurities, being comfortable in your own skin is the most valuable asset one can have." ~YouTube Comment_
    
*   _“You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection" ~Sharon Salzberg_
    
*   _“It’s normal enough to hold out for all that we want. Why would we celebrate hobbling, when we wish to run? Why accept friendship, when we crave passion? But if we reach the end of the day and no one has died, no further limbs have broken, a few lines have been written and one or two encouraging and pleasant things have been said, then that is already an achievement worthy of a place at the altar of sanity. How natural and tempting to put one’s faith in the bountifulness of the years, but how much wiser it might be to bring all one’s faculties of appreciation and love to bear on that most modest and most easily-dismissed of increments: the day already in hand."_

Whether it's yourself, the people you love, the companies you've started, the heroes you've chosen, the spouse you've linked with or the children you've raised, be ok with any and all of them disapointing you at one point or another. The world is a gritty place of incomplete people and non existent wholes. It is the world you live in and the only one you'll get. Learn to love it. Really. Somehow. Please. Embrace its imperfections and distance yourself from people who force their romantic ideals upon you. Misery loves company. Free yourself from the clinging need, accept value in darkness and live with dignity. Find good in the bad, not bad in the good. Somewhere in there is the closest I've come to understanding happiness."_

Sure you might fail, and god forbid someone might disapprove of the action you take....SO WHAT. You now know that like the air you breath disapproval is A CONSTANT. It cannot be avoided, and therefore it should be your friend. Ask yourself who are the people you admire in this society?  
    Is it the student who seeks the teacher's approval? Is it the person who accepts a menial day job because it's "safe" and very likely to get society's stamp of approval. You don't admire these people! You admire the risk taker! You admire the person that's willing to say what they want to say REGARDLESS OF DISAPPROVAL. You admire the entrepreneur who starts a business even though failure is imminent. It's the people who are living unapologetically the way they want BECAUSE THEY WANT TO....those are the people we love. Start being the person you admire...love yourself. Just remember, disapproval is a constant you must embrace. Live life on your standards, your reality...your rules. Go for what you want in life, not for other's approval, but for your own intrinsic satisfaction. Who gives a shit if people don't like what you say or do....accept their disapproval, AND DO IT ANYWAYS."_

*   _John Greenleaf Whittier wrote in his poem, “Maud Muller”, “Of the saddest words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these: It Might Have Been.” Don’t let that be true of you. Not because of your lost love but because of the lost loves and good times you could have had if only you were not wasting your life in regret and self-recrimination.  
    Strive to find joy. Because the truth of the matter is this: if there must be an absence of pain for joy to exist then we are all doomed. We must find a way to experience joy despite our pain. Everybody hurts. Everybody. But many, if not most, find a way to move on despite their pain and find some joy in life and not just find that joy but seek it out and squeeze all they can from it. That’s what you have to do also.  
    You hurt. Ok. I get it. Now what? Get moving. Improve your life and make yourself better for the next great opportunity. Or as Morgan Freeman says, “Get busy living or get busy dying.” When you waste your time in regret you are just committing slow motion suicide. Don’t do it._

*   _My friend, you are not bored with life. You are bored with what you are making of your life.  
    Look out there, for just five seconds. See the trees, the houses, the streets, the people. Out there are whole worlds to discover. There are arts to master. There are great works of fiction or memory to be read which will shake your inner core in ways you have never felt before. Life is not boring. What we make of this life often is. If your life consists of school, internet, an occasional meeting with friends, homework, eating, sleeping, masturbation, some sport and games - well, of course life is boring. What does it mean to say something is boring? It is without stimulation, without novelty and change. But this planet alone is so huge that you could spend twenty lifetimes and you would still not have seen everything there is to see in this world. There are so many wise and funny and crazy and beautiful and insightful and normal people to meet, so many countries to visit, foods to try, people to help, landscapes to admire - this world is huge. If you want to be not bored you can make your world not-boring by engaging with more of the world out there. You are not bored with life or the world. You are bored because you have made your life and your world very small. You are living in a small, sheltered bubble, chained by TVs and games and what feels like duties, to stay in this bubble. But you are bored. Why are you bored? Because you know that the life you are living is too small for you. Sleeping through the weekend is too small for you. Going to school, then home is too small for you. Playing computer games and watching movies is too small for you. Maybe even the people around you are too small for you. What you are missing is to go out and try new things. Oh, that's an effort? And you don't know how to get there? Well, fuck that, do it anyway. Get on the greyhound or whatever your countries' equivalent of cheap transport is, and go to a place you've not been before. Your smartphone has connection to amazing travel guides. Your camera in one hand, your smartphone (or better: a printed guide) in the other hand you can go and discover new worlds. Is there a big forest nearby? Get one or two good friends, a tent, sleeping bags and go, do it, just camp out in the woods for a weekend. Find out what it's like to poo in a hole and live from dry and cold food - or how to make a fire (don't burn the forest). Your life is boring you, not because the world is small, but because your world is small.  
    You have a choice:  
    Keep doing what is easy, the things you know, the things you have done before, the things that you are sure will be fun and safe.  
    Do something different every day. Walk through the city at night. Lay in an open field and try to count the stars. Dare to try new things even if you look stupid. Be the guy that follows his ideas and that drags others along, rather than the one that waits for others to suggest things. One of those versions you've tried.  
    One of those choices bores you. The other one scares you.  
    It is your choice: Remain bored or dare to do things you haven't done before. Your life will not be interesting unless you make it interesting._
    
*   _Being happy. It’s not one big thing for me but several:  
    Know yourself. Come to terms with who you are as a person, the role you play in others’ lives, and what your personal goals and priorities are.  
    Admit your flaws to yourself and then focus on your strengths, building them up, and playing to them.  
    Stop worrying about things that have happened or that might happen. Focus on today and tomorrow each day. Control what you can.  
    Invest in yourself and in things that cannot be taken away from you. These include health, knowledge, experiences, education/training, as well as tangible items. Getting out of debt or minimizing debt really does make you feel more free.  
    Treat other people the way you want to be treated. Be polite and respectful to others. Try to make other people smile and laugh and you will be amazed how much more you will find yourself smiling and laughing.  
    Be the adult. Don’t take shit from people. When people are giving you shit, call them out on it in the way a coach or teacher would. “Deborah, that’s not a respectful or professional tone and it doesn’t do any of us any good for you to speak that way. We are never going to finish this project if we can’t communicate and cooperate. We need to be a team and we can’t afford to cut each other down.”  
    Be more decisive. The only way you learn to be more decisive is to start making decisions and communicating them. People treat you differently when you act decisively.  
    Find things that amuse you and do them often. I like to drop quotes from classic comedies in otherwise serious situations and see who else in the room smiles. This kind of ties in to #4 and I do it multiple times per day. I also enjoy people watching and getting people to try new foods.  
    Put yourself first. I don’t mean be selfish or self-centered. I mean don’t do things that are bad for you to please other people. Don’t sacrifice your own sanity or safety or time or money for other people unless they really, really, really deserve it. It’s ok to look out for yourself and you shouldn’t apologize for it. Plus, you’re not able to help others until you have some stability yourself.  
    Stop worrying. Everyone wants you scared, confused, or in some way dependent so they can control you. Don’t fall for it. Stop consuming so much media and get outside more. Stop browsing Reddit and go to a play or a sporting event. Just stop letting outside forces make you think about and worry about shit you can’t control._
    
*   _"Carl Sagan. I realized that if I say I'm bored, it's like slapping Mother Earth in the face and telling her what she's offered me isn't good enough. That I need more, better. The universe is infinite outward and your mind is infinite inward. There is never a moment to be bored."_
    
*   _"Here's what I do. I stop drinking alcohol at 6pm on Sundays. I try to get, no less, than eight hours of sleep each night. I put everything I need in the morning out the night before (toothpaste, floss etc). I have my clothes laying out in the bathroom. My shoes are in the bathroom. While getting ready I listen to music in the morning. Not news. I take my dogs out for a leisurly walk. I listen to music on my drive to work. Not the news. I work at a job I love (31 years). I go home to a wife I love and walk the dogs I love. I don't drink Monday-Thursday. This works for me. By the way, I make less money than the national average. I'm still happy every day. You can be too. You just have to decide that that is how your going to see your life. There will always be someone better off and worse off than you are. Enjoy the days one at a time."_
    
*   _"So to those who are constantly depressed or maybe just stuck in a rut, give yourself a break. You are worth your life, and life is precious.

If you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel, then try to change the scenery, you are worth being happy."_
    
*   _"One small change that helped my perspective was to replace "I'm sorry" with "Thank you". For example, instead of saying "Sorry I'm late" , say " thank you for waiting for me" and that sort of thing. It made me realize how many little things I have to be thankful for each day :)"_
    
*   _"Constantly plan for events or occurrences that are outside of your day to day. It can be big like travelling to another country or as small as picking up a new video game. I find the constant anticipation to eventually meeting your goal is what gives me that high of enjoying life."_
    
*   _"Enjoying little things no matter how insignificant they seem. Like really savoring that first sip of hot cocoa, listening to the wind blow through the trees and how it makes the branches click together, enjoying the feel of my pets fur as I brush them, the hypnotic sound of pencil writing on paper. Life can be very mundane, but if you slow down sometimes you can find joy in the smallest of things.  
    This! I have a garden in my backyard. God are gardens great for the small moments. Sometimes we get butterflies, sometimes we get hummingbirds! Week to week or even day to day, you see changes. You can see the flowers forming on your plants. You can see your veggies getting big, flowering, fruiting, and ripening. There's so much magic going on with just air, sunlight, and a little water."_
    
*   _
    
    1.  Enjoy time spent alone. Being alone is scary for a lot of people. A lot especially don't know how to be alone with their thoughts. You don't need to isolate yourself or avoid people, but just be able to handle not having somebody to immediately talk to at all hours of the day. You'll end up finding you can actually enjoy yourself alone in ways you can't with the noise of company.
        
    2.  Maintain meaningful relationships. You shouldn't rely on others specifically to make you happy, but just enjoy the people you talk to. Make friends, pay attention to them, listen to them and gain enjoyment from hearing about their lives. Equally, share your own lives with people whom are happy to listen to you. Such moments day-to-day won't necessarily give your life meaning, but it'll keep up your mood.
        
    3.  Be a generally friendly person. If the same guy brings you your pizza each time, learn his name. Remembering him has 'Pete' rather than 'The pizza guy' can make even a small interaction be another small up in your day. You don't necessarily have to 'trust' everyone you meet, but by assuming the best in people when you can, and treating them that way, a lot of people will return that sentiment.
        
    4.  Take care of your body. Basic exercise, a proper diet, and a consistent sleep schedule, do a lot. A lot of it is just hormonal as well, when your body chemistry is in balance it positively affects other parts of your life as well. A bonus is that if you look healthy and feel well-rested, it'll positively impact your self-confidence and self-image.
        
    5.  Have some hobbies and enjoy them to their fullest. Enjoy learning more about them, and getting better at them. Don't compare yourself to others, only yourself. Being better each day than you were before is really rewarding; reminding yourself you're not as good as others is a pointless endeavor that only damages motivation.
        
    6.  Pour effort into anything worth doing. In your actual job, or your personal things, if you're actually taking the time to do something, do it properly. Not for anybody else's sake, but just to know you've done your best. Knowing you're half-assing your work and wasting your potential each day will just wear you down.
        
    7.  Explore yourself. Find a new hobby, meet a new person, try a few food, play a game, watch a movie, read a book, go to a new place. No matter what you do, being willing to explore new things means you always have an opportunity to find something you didn't know you loved. It also helps you fill your life with small fun things.
        
    8.  If you spend a lot of time in a specific area, try to make it aesthetically pleasing if possible. Perhaps your home, or your workspace, or anything. If you have to spend 8 hours in the same gray space everyday, eventually it'll affect your mood. But seeing some small colourful things can just be a little thing to keep your day going.
        
    9.  Change your attitude. Behind ever gray cloud is a silver lining. Behind every mistake is a change to grow. Behind every missed chance, is an opportunity for something new. Being willing to see things in a positive light, and to just enjoy the little things in your day, will really make a difference to your day-to-day. Even if you know the day is bad, see it as a positive day overall in some small way, and don't let it get to you.
        
    
    It's not a crime to take care of yourself or want to be happy. It doesn't matter it's selfish or if you deserve it or not. If you want to live a life you can be happy to live, then do so. Make small but consistent changes each day, and watch them build up to the life you really want.

There are many who, by virtue of their passivity, dependency, fear and laziness, seek to be shown every inch of the way and have it demonstrated to them that each step will be safe and worth their while. This cannot be done. For the journey of spiritual growth requires courage and initiative and independence of thought and action. While the words of the prophets and the assistance of grace are available, the journey must still be traveled alone. No teacher can carry you there. There are preset formulas. Rituals are only learning aids, they are not the learning. Eating organic food, saying five Hail Mary's before breakfast, praying facing east or west, or going to church on Sunday will not take you to your destination. No words can be said, no teaching can be taught that will relieve spiritual travelers from the necessity of picking their own ways, working out with effort and anxiety their own paths through the unique circumstances of their own lives toward the identification of their individual selves with God." ~Scott Peck, The road less traveled._

    ഞാനിടക്ക് ഓർക്കും ഗംഗക്ക് വയ്യാതെയായത് ഒരുതരത്തിൽ എനിക്കെത്ര നന്നായിയെന്ന്. പണ്ടൊക്കെ ശാരദപ്പച്ചിയോട് എനിക്ക് ദേഷ്യമായിരുന്നു, ഇപ്പോൾ ഓർക്കുമ്പോൾ ചിരി വരും.ഗംഗ ഇടക്ക് വിളിച്ചപ്പോൾ ചോദിച്ചു, നിനക്കെന്നോട് എപ്പോഴെങ്കിലും ദേഷ്യം തോന്നിയോയെന്ന്, നന്ദിയാണ് അവളോട്, ഒരിക്കലും കിട്ടില്ലെന്നു തോന്നിയ സ്നേഹം കിട്ടാനൊരു നിമിത്തമായതിന്. ഇനിയും തെക്കിനി തുറന്നാലേ വരുള്ളൂ എന്നുണ്ടോ?  
    അച്ഛൻ എപ്പോഴും ചോദിക്കുന്ന സണ്ണിയെ പറ്റി, അമ്മക്ക് പണ്ടേ ചോദ്യങ്ങളില്ലല്ലോ.  
    ഞാൻ ഇവിടെ ഗംഗ വച്ചിട്ട് പോയ പുസ്തകങ്ങളുടെ കൂടെയാണ്,മിക്കപ്പോഴും അന്നേനെ പൂട്ടിയിട്ട മുറിക്കുള്ളിൽ പോയിരിക്കും,അവിടെയിരിക്കുമ്പോൾ സണ്ണി പാടുന്നത് ഞാൻ കേൾക്കാറുണ്ട്.ഇപ്പോഴും ചിലരൊക്കെ എനിക്കെന്തോ കുഴപ്പമില്ലെയെന്ന രീതിയിൽ നോക്കാറുണ്ട്, ഇടക്ക് ഞാനാ ശാന്തേച്ചിയെ ഒന്ന് പേടിപ്പിച്ചു, പിന്നെ പാവം തോന്നി. പിന്നെ നാട്ടിലെ ഒന്ന് രണ്ട് വായിനോക്കികളെയും.ശ്രീദേവിക്ക് ഒരറ്റ ഭ്രാന്തെ ഉള്ളുവെന്നവർക്കറിയില്ലലോ.  
    ദേവീന്നു വിളിച്ചു കൊണ്ടെത്തുന്ന സണ്ണിക്കായി, ആരും വരാത്ത വഴിവക്കിൽ ഞാൻ കാത്തിരിക്കുന്നു.  
    എന്ന്  
    ശ്രീദേവി.”

*   _"I'm 26 years old, and I've spent my whole life waiting for something else to start. Now I realize that this is all there is, and I'm going to try to live my life like that. I have this theory that your body goes through puberty in its teens, and the mind goes through puberty in your twenties"_
    
*   _“We’ve been taught from such a young age that happiness is meant to be this big, all consuming thing. That it is this moment that cracks us open, and sweeps all of the weight inside of us away. That it is something we’re always in pursuit of until we find it. And so we are always waiting for happiness — this simplifying in life, this ‘aha’ moment where the wounds are healed and the growth is organized neatly within our ribcage and our hearts aren’t afraid and the warmth never leaves. But I don’t think happiness is big, or infinite at all. I think real happiness exists in the acceptance of the fact that we will always be balancing what is light and dark within ourselves. It exists in the quiet, in the small things. In a morning cup of coffee, in the sound of your mothers voice. I think real happiness is believing that you are meant to be here, that you are meant to take up space. I think real happiness is finding the human beings who take care of you — not in a materialistic way, but rather, finding those who take care of your soul, those who truly see you. I think real happiness is all around you, at all times, pinned and blooming in the things you stopped paying attention to because you were always searching for more. Flowers on your walk to work. The intensity in the air when you meet someone and you know they’re going to change your life. The way your stomach flips when you hear your favourite song, or when you hold the person who fills you with the sunniest kind of hope."_
    
*   _"I don't know if I will have the time to write any more letters because I might be too busy trying to participate. So if this does end up being the last letter, I just want you to know that I was in a bad place before I started high school, and you helped me. Even if you didn't know what I was talking about or know someone who's gone through it, you made me not feel alone. Because I know there are people who say all these things don't happen. And there are people who forget what it's like to be 16 when they turn 17. I know these will all be stories someday. And our pictures will become old photographs. We'll all become somebody's mom or dad. But right now these moments are not stories. This is happening. I am here and I am looking at her. And she is so beautiful. I can see it. This one moment when you know you're not a sad story. You are alive, and you stand up and see the lights on the buildings and everything that makes you wonder. And you're listening to that song and that drive with the people you love most in this world. And in this moment I swear, we are infinite." ~Perks of Being a Wallflower_
    
*   _"We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope"_
    
*   _"I’m an introvert.  
    At least I think I am. Sometimes I surprise myself with some sort of extroverted gesture that I then often regret and will overthink it retrospectively and feel anxious that I shouldn’t have expressed my extroverted side and instantly regret it.  
    I’m obsessive.  
    If I discover a book or movie or song or artist that I instantly fall in love with I will read, or watch or listen or stare obsessively at for days or weeks until my every thought is consumed by this thing.  
    I hide.  
    I hide from people, situations, confrontation and often myself.  
    I escape.  
    Always into a book, and feel free from every anxiety, every awkward one sided conversation, every regret, every fear of failure.  
    And finally, I am a dreamer.  
    I dream of being an author, or poet or script writer that writes something that maybe, just maybe, some other introvert somewhere can get obsessive about, or escape into when they want to hide from the world…..  
    just like me." ~@paperplanesundays_
    
*   _ചിലപ്പോൾ നിങ്ങൾക്ക് തോന്നാം ഇതല്ലാതെ ഒന്നും പറയാൻ ഉണ്ടാവാറില്ലേന്നു, എന്തെന്നാൽ  
    സ്നേഹിക്കപ്പെട്ടൂ എന്ന് അറിയുന്നതിനേക്കാൾ മനുഷ്യനെ സ്വാതന്ത്രനാക്കുന്ന ഒന്നും ഇല്ല  
    എല്ലാവരും ഒരിക്കലെങ്കിലും ഒരു കാമുക കണ്ണാലെ അവനവനെ കണ്ടു നോക്കണം  
    നമ്മളുടെ കൊച്ചു കൊച്ചു കുറവുകളിൽ ഓഹ് നമ്മൾ അത്ര നല്ലതല്ല എന്നൊക്കെ തോന്നുമ്പോൾ  
    ശരിക്കും സ്നേഹമുള്ള സന്തോഷമുള്ള കാരുണ്യമുള്ള നമ്മളെ തന്നെ ഒന്ന് കാണാൻ  
    ഇടക്കൊക്കെ ആരേലും കെട്ടിപിടിക്കണം, ഒന്നും മനസിലാവാതെ ഇരിക്കുന്ന ദിവസങ്ങളില്ലേ അപ്പൊ  
    അതിലും പ്രധാനം എന്താണെന്ന് അറിയോ, ഓടിച്ചെന്നു കെട്ടിപ്പിടിക്കാൻ ആരൊക്കെയോ ഉണ്ടെന്ന പ്രതീക്ഷ
