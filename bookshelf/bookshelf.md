This is a digital version of my bookshelf. I love having physical books, but lately most of my reading happens on Kindle. I actively look for book suggestions and recommendations. Books are a great way to get a variety of perspectives. This shelf includes the books I have read and [looking forward to reading](https://fs.blog/2013/06/the-antilibrary/).  
“_If I were to read a book for my entire adult life, I would have read maybe a thousand books. No more. But that’s only a tenth of a percent or so of the total number of books in the library. The trick is to know which books to read.”_   [~ Carl Sagan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRoWGRyc_3g)  
Borrowing Patrick Collison’s idea, the books marked in red are the ones I thought were great and very likely to be reread. This list doesn’t follow any particular order.
